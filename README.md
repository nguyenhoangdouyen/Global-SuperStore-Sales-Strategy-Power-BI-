## üìå Background & Overview ##
### Objective ###

üìñ **What is this project about?**  

- The Marketing team wants to launch personalized campaigns for customer retention and acquisition during the holiday season. However, due to the large dataset, manual segmentation is no longer feasible.  
- To solve this, the **RFM model** is applied using **Python (Colab)** to classify customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior.  
- This project involves **data preparation, RFM score calculation, segmentation, visualization, and providing actionable recommendations** for the Marketing and Sales teams to optimize their strategies.  

üë§ **Who is this project for?**  

‚úîÔ∏è Marketing & Sales Department  
‚úîÔ∏è Decision-makers & stakeholders  

‚ùì **Business Questions:**  

‚úîÔ∏è How can we segment customers effectively using the RFM model?  
‚úîÔ∏è Which customer groups should be prioritized for retention and promotional campaigns?  
‚úîÔ∏è What actionable insights can help improve marketing strategies and customer engagement?  
‚úîÔ∏è What strategies should be applied to different customer segments to maximize value?  

### RFM Analysis Overview  

**üîé Why use RFM?**  

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a customer analysis technique based on purchasing behavior.  
- **Recency**: Measures the time elapsed since a customer's last purchase.  
- **Frequency**: Evaluates how often a customer makes transactions.  
- **Monetary**: Calculates the total amount spent by the customer.  
By applying RFM, businesses can segment customers based on their value, allowing them to optimize marketing and customer engagement strategies.  

**üõ†Ô∏è How does RFM work?**

In RFM analysis, each customer is assigned a score based on these three factors. The data is then used to categorize customers into segments, helping businesses identify key audiences for targeted marketing and sales strategies.

## ‚öíÔ∏è **Main Process** ##

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  

**Step 1 : Reading and Understanding Data**

[In 1]:  
```python
# Import required libraries for dataframe and visualization
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import squarify
```

[In 2]:  
```python
# Load data into Colab  
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Define the path to the project folder
path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Python_Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng ƒê·ªó Uy√™n_RFM Project/'

# Load data from Excel file
ecommerce = pd.read_excel(path + 'ecommerce retail.xlsx', sheet_name='ecommerce retail')
segmentation = pd.read_excel(path + 'ecommerce retail.xlsx', sheet_name='Segmentation')

# Convert the files to CSV format
ecommerce.to_csv(path + 'ecommerce.csv', index=False)
segmentation.to_csv(path + 'segmentation.csv', index=False)
```

[In 3]:  
```python
# Print the first five rows of the dataset
ecommerce.head()
```
[Out 3]:

```python
# Print the first five rows of the dataset
ecommerce.head()
```

[In 5]:
```python
# Check Data Summary
ecommerce.describe()
```
[Out 5]:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6731170f-672e-4c4b-8493-a9721f239813)

‚ö°During the initial data exploration, it was observed that the **Quantity** and **Unit Price** columns contain negative values. This is not logically valid and requires further investigation. Possible actions include:
- Checking for data entry errors.
- Identifying whether negative values indicate refunds or cancellations.
- Removing or adjusting incorrect data points to ensure accuracy in analysis.

[In 6]:
```python
# Deeper Analysis on Stock Code and Invoice No
stock_code = ecommerce[['StockCode','InvoiceNo']].groupby('StockCode')['InvoiceNo'].agg('count').reset_index().sort_values(by='InvoiceNo', ascending=False)
print(stock_code.head(5))
print(stock_code.tail(5))
print(len(stock_code))
```
[Out 6]:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee24107-c599-4c7b-86c3-ed09cde6c8b3)

[In 7]:

```python
# Check frequency of each product description. This helps identify the most and least common products in transactions
description_check = ecommerce[['Description','InvoiceNo']].groupby(['Description']).count().reset_index().sort_values(by=['InvoiceNo'], ascending=False)
print(description_check.head())  # Top 5 most common descriptions
print(len(description_check))  # Total unique descriptions
```
[Out 7]:

### ‚ö° Data Quality Insights

During the initial data exploration, a mismatch was identified between **Stock Code** count (4070) and **Description** count (4223). This inconsistency suggests potential data quality issues that require further investigation. Possible reasons include:

- Some products may have multiple descriptions under the same stock code.
- Certain descriptions might not be linked to any valid stock code.
- Data inconsistencies due to missing, duplicated, or improperly recorded stock codes.

It is recommended to conduct additional validation and data cleaning to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.

[In 8]:
To validate and review the processed data, export the **description_check** dataframe to an Excel file.

```python
### Export Data for Double-Checking Orders
description_check.to_excel(path + 'description_check.xlsx')
```

[Out 8]:

### ‚ö† Manual Review Required

Some orders contain incorrect **descriptions** ‚Üí Perform a **manual check** and mark them as **errors** to facilitate further processing.

### üîÑ Merging Data for Error Identification

[In 9]:
To obtain a complete dataset with flagged erroneous orders, merge the **description_check_update** file with the **ecommerce** dataset.

```python
ecommerce_update = ecommerce.merge(description_check_update[['Description','Error']], how='left', on='Description')
```
### üîç Checking If Negative Quantities Indicate Cancellations

[In 10]:
To verify whether transactions with negative **Quantity** values are due to order cancellations (indicated by **InvoiceNo** starting with "C"), apply the following condition:

```python
ecommerce_update['InvoiceNo'] = ecommerce_update['InvoiceNo'].astype(str)
ecommerce_update['cancel_invoice'] = ecommerce_update.apply(
    lambda x: True if x['Quantity'] < 0 and x['InvoiceNo'].startswith('C') else False, axis=1)
```

### üö® Identifying Invalid Transactions

After flagging cancellations, verify if there are any transactions where **Quantity** is negative, but the **InvoiceNo** does not start with "C". These may indicate data inconsistencies.

[In 11]:
After flagging cancellations, verify if there are any transactions where **Quantity** is negative, but the **InvoiceNo** does not start with "C". These may indicate data inconsistencies.

```python
check_invalid_invoice = ecommerce_update[(ecommerce_update['cancel_invoice'] == False) & (ecommerce_update['Quantity'] < 0)]
print(len(check_invalid_invoice))  # Number of inconsistent records
check_invalid_invoice.head()  # Preview of invalid records
```
[Out 11]:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6708de9-d4fb-45a7-be28-ca4dfb886f99)

### ‚ö† Further Investigation: Negative Quantity Without Cancellation

After checking, it was found that some orders **do not have "C" in InvoiceNo** but still have **negative Quantity**. To analyze the cause, export the file for further review.

[In 12 ]:

```python
# Check for Negative Unit Prices
print(len(ecommerce_update[ecommerce_update['UnitPrice'] < 0 ]))  # Number of invalid records
print(ecommerce_update[ecommerce_update['UnitPrice'] < 0 ].head())  # Preview of invalid records
print(len(ecommerce_update[ecommerce_update['UnitPrice'] < 0 ]))  # Number of invalid records
ecommerce_update[ecommerce_update['UnitPrice'] < 0 ].head()  # Preview of invalid records
```

[Out 12 ]:

## ‚ú® General Observations

### **Data Types:**
The following columns have inappropriate data types and should be converted to **strings** for easier processing:
- **InvoiceNo**, **StockCode**, **Description**, **CustomerID**, **Country**.

### **Data Values:**
- **Quantity < 0 & InvoiceNo starts with 'C'** ‚Üí These transactions indicate **canceled orders** and should be **removed** from the dataset.
- **Quantity < 0 but InvoiceNo does NOT start with 'C'** ‚Üí These records contain **incorrect descriptions** and should be **excluded** from the dataset.
- **UnitPrice < 0 & incorrect Description** ‚Üí These are **invalid transactions** and should also be **removed** from the dataset.
